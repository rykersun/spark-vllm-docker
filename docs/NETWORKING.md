# DGX Spark Networking

The following guide is for two node cluster, but it is also applicable to larger clusters.

See [this post](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/6x-spark-setup/354399/56) for an example of 6-8 node Spark cluster.
Please keep in mind that to get the most from vLLM you need to have number of nodes that corresponds to power of 2 - e.g. 2, 4 or 8 nodes. 

The guide assumes that the nodes are named `spark` and `spark2`, but you can use any names.
Same with IP addresses: we use `192.168.177.0/24` subnet with `.11` and `.12` assigned to both nodes, but you can use any IP addresses, as long as they are in the same subnet.

## DGX Spark ConnectX quirks

DGX Spark has a pretty unique ConnectX setup.

To achieve 200G transfer speed, ConnectX NIC needs ~x8 PCIe 5.0 lanes.

However, DGX Spark SOC can't provide more than x4 PCIe lanes per device due to hardware limitations.
So to achieve 200G on a single cable connection, each physical port shares the same pair of PCIe5 x4 connections.
Each PCIe 5 x4 link is represented by two Ethernet and two RoCE interfaces:

```bash
eugr@spark:~$ ibdev2netdev
rocep1s0f0 port 1 ==> enp1s0f0np0 (Down)
rocep1s0f1 port 1 ==> enp1s0f1np1 (Up)
roceP2p1s0f0 port 1 ==> enP2p1s0f0np0 (Down)
roceP2p1s0f1 port 1 ==> enP2p1s0f1np1 (Up)
```

In this case, the single cable is plugged in the outermost QSFP port (the right one if looking from the back).
This port has two pairs of "twins" associated with it:

- Ethernet: `enp1s0f1np1` and `enP2p1s0f1np1`
- RoCE/IB: `rocep1s0f1` and `roceP2p1s0f1`

Each of the twins represents one PCIe x4 link and can provide up to 100G link speed.

For vLLM, we need RDMA over RoCE, so Ethernet speed is not that important, that's why we can assign IP only to one of the ports - in this case `enp1s0f1np1`.
However, in order to get full bandwidth in NCCL RDMA mode, we need to utilize **both** RoCE twins. It is achieved by setting `NCCL_IB_HCA` to both RoCE interfaces: `export NCCL_IB_HCA=rocep1s0f1,roceP2p1s0f1`

`./launch-cluster.sh` does this automatically, along with autodiscovery of interfaces, so as long as you set up your Ethernet interface properly, vLLM will utilize both RoCE twins.

Also, note that connecting two Sparks using **both** ports won't give you any noticeable advantage in bandwidth, so single connection is sufficient.
If you connect 3 Sparks by daisy-chaining them, you will only be able to sustain 100G between each pair of Sparks.

## Connecting more than 2 Sparks in the cluster

To connect more than 2 Sparks, you will need a proper switch, for example [Microtik CRS812-DDQ](https://mikrotik.com/product/crs812_ddq).
Please refer to [this post](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/6x-spark-setup/354399/56) for an example of setting up a 6-8 node Spark cluster.

## Network setup

Assuming both are connected using rightmost QFSP port (when looking from the back).

Create `/etc/netplan/40-cx7.yaml` on `spark`:
```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    enp1s0f1np1:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no              # Explicitly disable DHCPv6
      link-local: [ ipv4 ]   # Restrict link-local addresses to IPv4 only
      mtu: 9000
      addresses: [192.168.177.11/24]
    enP2p1s0f1np1:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      link-local: [ ipv4 ]
      mtu: 9000
```

Create `/etc/netplan/40-cx7.yaml` on `spark2`:
```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    enp1s0f1np1:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no              # Explicitly disable DHCPv6
      link-local: [ ipv4 ]   # Restrict link-local addresses to IPv4 only
      mtu: 9000
      addresses: [192.168.177.12/24]
    enP2p1s0f1np1:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      link-local: [ ipv4 ]
      mtu: 9000
```

Please note, that only one interface of the "twin" pair needs an IP address, but MTU needs to be set on both.
You can also assign a separate address to another "twin" if you want to utilize the second interface independently, but make sure you assign an IP address from a different subnet.

For instance, for the example above, if you want to assign an IP to `enP2p1s0f1np1`, you need to use `192.168.177.12` on `spark`. **DO NOT use the same subnet on both "twins"** - it will confuse autodiscovery and mess up routing.

This will not affect vLLM performance as it will use RDMA over RoCE using both "twins", even if the IP is only set on one.

Then run on each node:

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/netplan/40-cx7.yaml
sudo netplan apply
```

Set up passwordless ssh. On spark:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/dgx-spark-playbooks/refs/heads/main/nvidia/connect-two-sparks/assets/discover-sparks
chmod +x discover-sparks
./discover-sparks
```

MTU setting (testing):

```bash
sudo ip link set dev enp1s0f1np1 mtu 9000
```

Benchmark connection (use perftest package):
